<p>I have always been passionate about foreign languages and I thrive on this sector through the translation of English and Italian documents. After following a <strong>Foreign Languages Degree</strong> path, I obtained a <strong>Master’s degree in Technical Translation</strong> in 2010.</p>

<p>I then moved to Italy where <strong>I worked for 7 years</strong> in a translation agency. During this period, I translated and proofread documents of different types, managed translation projects and gained the terminology related to various areas. During all these years, I enriched my language and immersed myself into the culture of the country.</p>

<p>Today, I work as a freelance translator, specialising in the areas of <strong>Cosmetics</strong>, <strong>Tourism &amp; Travels</strong> and <strong>Marketing</strong>, but I also offer services in many other technical fields.</p>

<h3>Working method</h3>

<p>Whatever the nature of the document, I translate with the utmost care, while <strong>respecting your confidentiality, your requirements and the agreed deadlines</strong>. I reproduce the essence of your messages faithfully into my mother tongue, <strong>making sure that I adapt them to the culture of my country</strong>.
