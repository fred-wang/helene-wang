    <p>Translation is not only the transposition from one language into another.</p>
    <p>It’s a journey into the heart of the text, a getaway into the universe of languages, where the translator explores each nuance, each expression and each play on words…</p>
    <p>It’s also a long haul, where the translator, intrepid, crosses the text full of pitfalls and loses himself for an instant… before leaving again towards his destination.</p>
