<p><strong>Translating</strong> involves an excellent <strong>knowledge of the language of the source text</strong> in order to understand the message in all its subtleties and to perceive its chosen tone. It also requires <strong>a familiarity with the subject</strong> and <strong>in-depth knowledge of the terminology</strong> specific to the sector.</p>

<p><strong>The golden rule is to translate into one’s mother tongue</strong>. Why? Because the mother tongue is the one we know best, the one which cradled us, the one with which we grew up with. Its nuances, its subtleties and its cultural elements don’t have any secrets for us. The result is a fluid and natural text where the influence of the source text isn’t felt in the structure of the sentences or in the choice of words.</p>

<p>Having graduated as a <strong>French native</strong> translator and lived in <strong>England and Italy</strong>, I am available for the following services:</p>

<p>I specialise in the following areas:</p>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/cosmetique.jpg" alt="Cosmetics"/></span></p>

<p><strong>Cosmetics</strong>: translation of cosmetics documents requires in-depth knowledge of the sector. It is essential to respect the terminology belonging to the cosmetics industry in order to guarantee a translation which conforms to the European standards.</p>

<p>Combining poetry and marketing, I translate <strong>make-up products, skin and hair care products, perfumes, beauty and wellness accessories</strong>.</p>

<p>These can be <strong>product names, packaging, product datasheets, leaflets, training kits, marketing materials, tutorials</strong>…</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/tourisme-voyages.jpg" alt="Tourism &amp; Travel"/></span></p>

<p><strong>Tourism &amp; Travel</strong>: to translate touristic texts you not only need to be able to write elegantly but also to have a good knowledge of the culture of the target public. It is essential to adapt the words or expressions that the reader could interpret differently according to his or her nationality. </p>

<p>Some examples of documents I translate: <strong>touristic brochures, catalogues of products and services, websites, presentations of hotels or any other tourist establishments, newsletters, descriptions of countries, regions and towns, museum guides, restaurant menus, publicity campaigns, SEO contents</strong>…</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/marketing.jpg" alt="Marketing"/></span></p>

<p><strong>Marketing</strong>: the translation of marketing texts requires not only a good knowledge of the chosen target market in order to adapt the language and the tone, but also an understanding of the industry terminology. It is therefore necessary to modulate the style, the language and the choice of words to communicate the desired message effectively.</p>

<p>I translate texts such as <strong>press releases, advertising supports, corporate presentations, marketing plans, newsletters, brochures</strong>…</p>

<a id="revision" class="top-spacing"></a>
<h3 id="revision">Proofreading</h3>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/revision.jpg" alt="Proofreading"/></span></p>

<p>I check your texts in French comparing them with the source document in order to verify the exactness of the translation. I correct each mistake, such as <strong>errors related to typos, omissions, grammar, orthography, punctuation and syntax</strong>. I also amend any <strong>stylistic mistakes</strong> modifying the structures of the sentences to produce a more fluid text. Finally, I fix the layout if there are any differences compared with the source text and I check that the <strong>typographic rules</strong> of the French language have been applied.</p>

<h3 id="transcription">Audio/Video Transcription</h3>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/transcription.jpg" alt="Transcription"/></span></p>

<p>I provide a transcription service of your French audio or video files (<strong>interviews, reports, meeting speeches</strong>…). Based on your preferences, the transcription can be delivered in Word, TXT or Excel format. You can choose between two types of transcription:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Integral transcription</strong>: this is a faithful reproduction, word-to-word. This transcription includes all the hesitations, repetitions, onomatopoeias…</li>
  <li><strong>Proofread transcription</strong>: this is a reformulation of the speech into a written style (suppression of the repetitions and the hesitations, corrections of the syntax errors…). This proofread transcription produces a fluid text and is easier to read.</li>
</ul>
